# RTProfileSelector #

### RTProfileSelector is a [RawTherapee](http://rawtherapee.com/) plugin that automatically selects custom processing profiles (*.pp3* files) based on user-defined rules.  The rules are sets of Exif fields and values which are matched against the actual values extrated from the RAW files. RTProfileSelector uses [ExifTool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) for extracting metadata from images.

### Besides processing profile selection based on comparison of Exif fields, RTProfileSelector can currently also apply lens and focal length specific distortion correction if supplied with simple user defined "lens profiles".

### For information on how to install and use RTProfileSelector, have a look at the tutorials in the [wiki section](https://github.com/marcapelini/RTProfileSelector/wiki).
