These are just some sample files that I have included so that you can test
RTProfileSelector with the provided sample rules and profiles:

- P1090268.RW2: picture taken with a Panasonic GM1, 12-32 F3.5-5.6 lens, 
	at 12mm, photo style "Monochrome"
	
- CPB_temp_7.txt: temporary file generated by RhawTherapee and passed as
	parameter to RTPS when processing P1090268.RW2. You can	edit the entries 
	in the "[RT General]" section to test/debug RTPS on your system
	
- exif_fields.txt: file generated by RTPS from P1090268.RW2 when "ViewExifKeys=1" 
	is declared in RTProfileSelector.ini
	
- Generic BW.pp3: a basic B&W profile for testing the rules that I have included
	in RTProfileSelectorRules.ini. This is not my real "Generic BW" profile as
	I currently use a combination of adjustments and film simulation in RT, but 
	should give you an idea of what I was after when I wrote RTPS.
